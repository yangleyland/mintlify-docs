## Major release: Enhanced feedback collection

- **Major improvement**: Readers can now give more detailed feedback after selecting _thumbs up/down_, including options and written comments. You can also collect feedback on code blocks and view all responses in your dashboard analytics.\
  _Note: Contact us to enable this feature for your site._

## Navigation and quality of life improvements

- Quality of life improvement to ignore trailing slashes and double slashes so you don't have to worry about getting them exactly right in your docs.json
- You can now add a `noAnchor` attribute to your `h1-6` HTML tags to avoid them having an anchor link
- The Palm theme now has a floating language selector in the bottom left similar to Stripe's approach
- Added a new field to the docs.json called [`drilldown`](https://mintlify.com/docs/navigation#enable-auto-navigation-for-groups) which allows you to control whether or not users are navigated to the first page in a navigation group when the group is expanded
- Quality of life improvement to make nested ordered lists alternate styles from decimal/Roman to alpha

## Bug fixes and reliability

- Fixed a bug where scroll position anchor links weren't working correctly when there were JS components on a page
- Fixed a bug where Google was indexing raw `*.md` files because they were missing a `x-robots-tag noindex` header
- Fixed a bug with OAuth on protected docs where it wouldn't redirect you back to your starting page once you completed the flow successfully
- Fixed a bug on previews of auth protected docs where you weren't able to see the entire navigation bar
- Bug fixes to how SVGs are handled with our new image CDN

## Component and styling enhancements

- Added a new CSS selector for custom styles on `SidebarNavGroupDivider`
- New regression tests for MDX defined API pages that have security defined on them will ensure a greater degree of stability

## Performance improvements

- Performance improvement by moving the KaTeX CSS from cdnjs to our own CDN on Cloudfront for reduced latency
