## Assistant improvements

- **Starter questions for assistant are here! You can add your own within the dashboard at [Assistant --> Settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/mintlify/mintlify/products/assistant/settings)**
- Assistant insights quality has been improved with default spam protection for abusive keywords and JSON queries.

## API playground improvements

- The API playground now automatically fills in default values for parameters, which saves time when testing endpoints.
- Issues with `allOf`, `oneOf`, and nested object schemas that previously caused rendering problems or incorrect field displays have been fixed, and complex API schemas now render correctly with all fields visible and properly structured.
- Enum and nullable field types now display accurate labels in the playground, which makes it clearer what values are accepted and whether fields are optional.
- When working with nested objects in API requests, the playground now shows proper descriptive labels for each field instead of generic placeholders, which makes it easier to understand what data to provide.
- Enum const tables and API field displays now render with improved formatting and alignment, which makes it easier to scan available options and understand field requirements.
- API playground modals now display rich MDX-formatted descriptions at the top, which gives better context for endpoints with formatted text, links, and code examples.

## Analytics changes

- Deferred analytics loading: PostHog and LogRocket now load after documentation content, which improves initial page load times and Core Web Vitals scores without affecting analytics data.
- Conditional session recording: PostHog session recording can now be enabled conditionally based on user properties or page context for more control over when recordings happen.

## Visual improvements

- Tables now have better alignment, consistent spacing, and enhanced readability. Headers align properly with their content columns.

## Bug fixes

- Fixed link overflow issues that caused horizontal scrolling on mobile devices. Links now wrap properly within their containers.
- Improved LaTeX/math block styling for better readability and consistent formatting.
- Added `playsInline` and autoplay props to video embeds so they work correctly on iOS devices.
- Updated Claude icon with proper border-radius for visual consistency.
- Fixed `/llms.txt` routing so LLM agents can properly access documentation.
- Prevented infinite schema expansion in complex OpenAPI specs that could cause browser crashes.
- Removed x-overflow in Palm theme that was cutting off text in the API playground.
- Increased content font-size to improve compatibility with browser reader modes.
- Fixed Google login button styling for better visual consistency.
