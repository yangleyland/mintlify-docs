Get your documentation site live in under 5 minutes. This guide walks you through creating your first Mintlify documentation project from setup to deployment.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- Git installed on your machine
- GitHub account (for deployment)

## Install Mintlify

Install the Mintlify CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g mintlify
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
mintlify --version
```

## Create your documentation

Initialize a new documentation project:

```bash
mintlify init my-docs
cd my-docs
```

This creates a new directory with:
- `docs.json` - Configuration and navigation
- `introduction.mdx` - Your first page
- `mint.json` - Theme and styling settings

## Start the development server

Launch the local development server:

```bash
mintlify dev
```

Your documentation site opens at `http://localhost:3000`. The server automatically reloads when you make changes.

## Add your first page

Create a new page in your project directory:

```bash
touch getting-started.mdx
```

Add content to `getting-started.mdx`:

```mdx
